# ML_Algo_Mental-Health-Analysis-from-Journaling
This dataset simulates anonymized journaling entries from users of a mental health journaling app. Each row represents one journal entry with text and derived features (sentiment, emotions, etc.). The goal is to detect early signs of mental health deterioration and classify users into risk categories.
